## Using pymaiden

To get pymaiden, clone the repository with GitHub CLI or download a ZIP file of the pymaiden project and unzip the  these files into our new project's root file folder.

Then create a new virtual environment within your new project folder.

Windows:

    C:\dev\pymaiden>python -m venv pyvenv

Linux:

    ~/dev/pymaiden>python -m venv pyvenv

Activate the virtual environment

Windows:

    C:\dev\pymaiden>pyvenv\scripts\activate.bat

(pyvenv) C:\dev\pymaiden>

Linux:

    ~/dev/pymaiden>chmod +x pyvenv/bin/activate
    ~/dev/pymaiden>source pyvenv/bin/activate

(pyvenv) ~/dev/pymaiden>

Install the support modules required by pymaiden.

    (pyvenv) ... >pip install -r requirements.txt

To use the provided command line program (cli_demo.py) or the GUI program (pymaiden_tk_gui.py) use the following commands.

    (pyvenv) ... >python cli_demo.py
    (pyvenv) ... >python pymaiden_tk_gui.py

To use pymaiden within your own project, you will need to import the pymaiden module into it.

    import pymaiden

If you place the pymaiden.py and gridtables.py files in a folder other your projects root folder, you will need to learn how to setup a odule directory and how to reference it in your import call.

## Maidenhead Grid Locator System description

The Maidenhead Grid Locator System provides a reasonably accurate global
location through the use of a concise identifier that can be
2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 characters in length depending on the accuracy desidered.
Example ID: "IO91dm35VE". This ID is broken down as IO, 91, dm, 35 and VE.
The first character of each pair indicates the Longitude and the second
character indicates the Latitude of the grid box. I, 9, d, 3,
and V provide Longitude data and O, 1, m, 5, and E provide Longitude data.
Each successive pair increases the accuracy of the grid location.  

The first Field level grid ID is AA. This is the most SW location this system
defines. The SW corner of AA is at -180 Lon and -90 Lat or S90,W180. Hence, in
all operations performed by this module, the SW corner is the starting for grid
location calculations.

## Maidenhead Grid ID pair descriptions

### First character pair (Field): [AR]
Character range: A through R (18)\
The globe is gridded into 324 Fields of size 20 degrees longitude by 10
degrees latitude. The first Field level grid ID is AA. The SW corner of
AA is the starting point of the grid system.\
Total global Fields: 324

### Second character pair (Square): AR[09]
Character range: 0 through 9 (10)\
Each Field is gridded into 100 Squares of the size 2 degrees longitude
by 1 degree latitude.\
Total global Squares: 32,400

### Third character pair (Subsquare): AR09[ax]
Character range: a through x (24)\
Each Square is broken down into 576 Subsquares of
the size 5 minutes longitude and 2.5 minutes latitude.\ 
Total global Subsquares: 18,662,400

### Fourth character pair (Extended squares): AR09ax[09]
Character range: 0 through 9 (10)\
Each Subsquare is broken down into 100 Extended squares of
the size 30 seconds longitude and 15 seconds latitude.\
Total global Extended squares: 1,866,240,000

### Fifth character pair (Super extended squares): AR09ax09[AX]
